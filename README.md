# Spoken Swahili Digit Dataset
Free Spoken Swahili Digit Dataset (FSSDD) is a spoken digit dataset for Swahili language. This language is spoken in east and central Africa. The speech utterances were recorded from 8 regions of Tanzania. The recordings were recorded at diverse office environment conditions with different noise conditions such as: air-conditioner sounds, walking sounds, door open or close sounds, phone ringing sounds, people talking sounds, bird sounds, and car horn sounds. The quality of the recordings is at 8kHz in wav files. All recordings are trimmed and padded to a fixed length of 0.74 seconds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first public Swahili spoken digit dataset. 
FSSDD will continue to grow over time as data is contributed from different parts of East African Community. 
## Current status:
* 30 speakers
* 3000 recordings (100 per each digit per speaker)
* Swahili pronunciations
* 8 Regions- Dar-es-salaam, Kilimanjaro, Kagera, Njombe, Pwani, Mara, Rukwa, and Tanga.
## Naming format
Files are named in the following format similar to that of [FSDD](https://github.com/Jakobovski/free-spoken-digit-dataset "FSDD") : {digitLabel}_{speakerName}_{index}.wav
