# Spoken Swahili Digit Dataset
Free Spoken Swahili Digit Dataset (FSSDD) is a spoken digit dataset for Swahili language. This language is spoken in most countries of East African Community. The speech utterances were recorded from only 8 regions in Tanzania. The recordings were recorded at a diverse office environment conditions with different noise conditions such as: Outside car horns, other peopleâ€™s voices, phone ringing tones, closing/opening door sound, birds voices, air-condition sound etc. The quality of the recordings is at 8kHz in wav files. All recordings are trimmed and padded to a fixed length of 0.74 seconds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first public Swahili spoken digit dataset. 
FSSDD will continue to grow over time as data is contributed from different parts of East African Community. 
## Current status:
* 30 speakers
* 3000 recordings (100 per each digit per speaker)
* Swahili pronunciations
